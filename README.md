<h1>DNA Transportation LLC Website</h1>

<p>
  This website is being built for a private business. The client has expressed interest in increasing their search engine ranking to bring in more business online.
</p>
<p>
  That being the case, I developed the site on JAMStack tech - specifically, a statically generated Gatsby/React/GraphQL build deployed to Netlify. 
</p>

<h3>Why?</h3>

<p>
  Since the client is interested in gaining rank on search engines, SEO was naturally a key consideration factor in choosing to roll a site featuring SSR. In addition to the SEO benefits Gatsby's out of the box SSR functionality offers, the site makes extensive use of their pretty-amazing image plugin to dramatically improve load times. Additionally, I selected a modular CSS framework (Bulma) to avoid style bloat,another key performance consideration.
